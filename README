 
how to:
	backend (Laravel)
		run the migrations & seeders
		run php artisan serve
		verify by running tests
		APIs
			get /api/pages
			get /api/pages/page_path
			post /api/pages
				parent_id
				title
				slug
				content
				
				
	
	frontend (VueJS)
		consists of html files and can be executed by loading the pages.html file in modern browser
		on slightly older versions of firefox (and some other brwosers) you may need to enable importmap


important decisions and assumptions
-	my npm installation was giving me trouble with Vue at the moment so I took the CDN approach
